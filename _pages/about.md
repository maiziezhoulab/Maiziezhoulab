Welcome to the VCBL â€“ Maizie Zhou Lab!

We develop algorithms and mathematical models to address biological and neuroscience questions. We investigate multiple dimensions of these questions, spanning computational genomics, bioinformatics, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.

Areas of Research: structural variant detection in personal and cancer genomes, haplotype phasing, reference-assisted assembly, machine learning, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics technologies, and analysis of neural circuits in natural and artificial neural networks.

About me

Research 
======
My group focuses on **human factors and human-centered AI for software engineering**, including
human cognition, AI for software engineering, sustainability for open source software, and computer
science education. 
Our work aims to bridge the divide between human cognition and automated models for programming.
Our work spans software,
hardware, AI, medical imaging (fMRI and fNIRS), eye tracking, and mobile sensing, collaborating with researchers from Security, Education, Psychology and Neuroscience.
We also work on social aspects in the software engineering community.
	
All (but not limited to) the following questions are of interest in my group and I look
forward to hearing crazy ideas from students!

- How do programming experts become experts?
- How do programmers comprehend and write code? How do they really think in programming tasks?
- How and why do programmers make mistakes in programming?
- How can we learn from human cognition and expertise to improve automated models in
  programming?
<!-- - How can we defend our system in the existence of cognitive biases? -->
- How can we improve participation and diversity in programming?
